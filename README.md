# Marcenko Pastur & PCA
WIP repo in which I implement the PCA algorithm using Julia; along with this, I plan to create a quasi-pipeline for helping choose a "good" lower-dimensional subspace by looking at the eigenvalue distribution of the sample covariance matrix.

This repo might evolve into more general random matrix tools given enough time
